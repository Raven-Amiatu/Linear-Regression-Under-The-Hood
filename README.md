# Linear-Regression-Under-The-Hood

This notebook delves into Linear Regression from scratch, focusing on implementing the least squares estimation method to construct a regression model. Utilizing the Boston Housing dataset, which contains median house values (medv) for 506 neighborhoods in Boston, our objective is to develop a simple regression model to predict medv based on lstat, the percentage of households with low socioeconomic status.

To accomplish this, we implement the linear regression model using NumPy and evaluate its performance using key statistical metrics, including Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), RÂ², and Residual Standard Error (RSE). Furthermore, we assess the suitability of linear regression for this dataset by analyzing residual plots and model evaluation metrics to determine its effectiveness.
